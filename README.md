# Glioma-Data-Algorithm

Applied 4 machine learning techniques: artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and classical logistic regression (LR) to a dataset consisting of 76 WHO grade 1-4 glioma patients.

We studied whether machine learning could achieve accurate prognostication in a small, high-dimensionality database consisting of gliomas of all stages.

We also compared the effect of censoring statistically insignificant variables from ML input, with that of using uncensored data.

The models have been implemented using scikit-learn in the models.py(https://github.com/rhettdsouza13/Glioma-Data-Algorithm/blob/master/models.py) script.
